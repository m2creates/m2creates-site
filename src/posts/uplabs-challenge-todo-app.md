{% UpLabs { title: "To-Do App Challenge", prompt: "Design a friendly and engaging To-Do app for mobile or web.", challengers: '293', results: 'https://www.uplabs.com/challenges/todo-app-challenge/results', submission: 'https://www.uplabs.com/posts/list-it', placement: 'Honorable mention' } %}

I made a to-do list web app (with vue.js) that tracks your completion progress. After almost two-weeks deciding on a UI I'd use for my own tracking, I couldn't decide on what submit for the Uplabs challenge... because [I also made a materialized version](https://m2creates.github.io/experiments/listit).
