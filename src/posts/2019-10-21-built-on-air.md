I had the incredible opportunity to be featured on the "Built on Air Podcast." It was a chance to share my unique journey from the world of archaeology to the cutting-edge of technology. This transition has been a pivotal part of my life, highlighting the limitless potential when we dare to pivot our careers.

My journey has been anything but ordinary. Starting in archaeology, I found myself increasingly drawn to the digital realm. My shift to freelance web design and development marked a significant chapter in my life. It underscored the importance of adapting and evolving professionally.

### The Airtable Revelation

Discovering Airtable was a game-changer for me. It revolutionized how I managed and automated my projects. This tool didn't just help me organize my work; it redefined my entire workflow, bringing a new level of efficiency and creativity to my endeavors.

### Equestrian Assessment Tracker: A Deep Dive

One of my standout projects involved developing an assessment tracker for an equestrian course provider. [This case study](https://deytah.io/project/automating-away-paper-postage-for-an-equestrian-assessment-tracker/) was a deep dive into the complexities of data migration, automation, and data display in Airtable. It was a testament to the versatility and power of this tool.

### Concluding Thoughts

Reflecting on my journey, the shift from archaeology to technology has been more than a career change. It's been about embracing technology and no-code solutions for creative problem-solving.
