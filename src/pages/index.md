I'm Melanie Magdalena, aka M2, and I create things.

I'm on a mission to create a web for everyone by blending accessibility, inclusivity, and usability into web experiences, digital media, and automated systems. [Learn more about me](/about) or [explore my highlights](/highlights/).

I've **shipped** some cool stuff alongside my **side projects**. [View Project list](/projects/).

I'm always adding to my **toolbox** for no-code solutions, digital design, front-end development and more! [View my Uses list](/uses/).

This website is under construction and #BuiltInPublic. [Join me on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/m2creates) to follow along, or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/m2creates) for snapshots.
