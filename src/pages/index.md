I'm Melanie Magdalena, aka M2, and I create things.

I'm currently creating blog posts about mindfulness, [far too many images for Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/m2creates), and [random crafts](https://tiktok.com/@m2creates).

[Learn more about me](/about/) or [explore my highlights](/highlights/).

[I've also worked on some projects](/projects/) over the years.

I'm always adding goodies to [my toolbox](/uses/) for digital marketing, website building, and other useful things (that typically have a free plan). Plus hardware, of course. I need to add my crafting supplies to that list at some point...

This website is permanently under construction and proudly #BuiltInPublic. Pardon the dust!
