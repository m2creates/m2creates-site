I'm on a mission to create a web for everyone by:

- blending accessibility, inclusivity, and usability
- into web experiences, digital media, and automated systems

I have a Bachelor's of Science in Anthropology â€“ concentrated in Archaeology with a minor in Earth and Planetary Science â€“ aka I have a piece of paper to dig up dead peoples' trash ðŸ˜‰. Anthropology is probably the most useful degree to learn about how people not only think, but how they interact with the world around them.

- I've traveled around Mesoamerica for research and fun. [**You're invited to explore my journey**](https://changelog.melaniemagdalena.com) from archaeology to web tech, their intersection, and all the fun bits in between.

I'm self-taught in digital media, design strategy, development, and accessibility. I love open source, open science, and open knowledge.

**Let's create a web for everyone!**
