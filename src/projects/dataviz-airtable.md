[**Data Viz**](https://dataviz-airtable.carrd.co/) for Airtable was a project I live-streamed for the #24HourStartup weekend. The extension allows you to quickly see your Airtable data in a chart on every new tab. I'd love to expand on this project in the future with multiple charts and extend it to a Google Data Studio connector.
