Since 2009, I've been working on [**Origins Scientific Research Society**](https://knowyourorigins.org/) â€“ a publishing platform for undergrads and non-traditional scientists to share their research.

The project is on hold. I have new tools and techniques nowadays that I think _might_ be the trick to a sustainable framework. (No more InDesign!) Until then, you can browse prior issues in all their flipbook glory and learn about some neat stuff!
