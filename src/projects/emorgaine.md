Web & Graphic Design

- I've been working with Morgan on her various websites from Blogger to Weebly then Carrd and (currently) Webflow.
- I also drew both her logos :D (When I first designed the E-Morgaine logo I did not own professional graphics software, so the result was an arduous combination of Microsoft Paint and PowerPoint!!)
