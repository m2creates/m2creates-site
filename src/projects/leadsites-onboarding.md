UX Developer @ Easy Agent Pro:

- **Responsibilities:** User Research and Analytics.
- **The goal:** Identify "aha" moments to present on the Dashboard starting page to inform users of required next steps, easy first actions, and encourage product exploration.
- **The result:** Instead of prompting users to connect Google Analytics immediately, Onboarding provides all LeadSite users simple actions to take during their trial period. Additionally, Mixpanel was installed to track completion rate and reach out to new users who need additional help.
