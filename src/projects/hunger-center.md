Web Design & WordPress Development:

- **Responsibilities:** Stakeholder interviews, information architecture (IA) design, wireframes, web design, custom development, analytics implementation, and hosting optimizations.
- **The goal:** Redesign the Congressional Hunger Center website to direct various audiences to the most relevant content, give the organization room to grow with additional program offerings, create smart reusable content blocks, be mobile responsive, and have a new, fresh modern look.
- **The result:** The new website launched in September 2019 complete with reusable and interactive content thoughtfully narrated for each audience type. The new site is clean, modern and features an abundance of imagery.
- **The future:** Using analytics through events, goals, and segments, I look forward to assisting the organization with optimizing their application process for fellowship and internship cohorts.
