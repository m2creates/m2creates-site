Web Design:

- **Responsibilities:** Wireframing, Content Strategy, Web Design, and Accessibility.
- **The goal:** Design a low-cost, low-maintenance site to present architecture and education services that is macular degeneration future-proof.
- **The result:** Archinia relaunched with AA standards in place with a visual portfolio of work in preservation, education, sustainability, and more!
- **The future:** The site is publicly available on GitHub for continued collaboration to reach AAA standards and transcribe every photograph in alt text so Rachel will always be able to see her work through words.
- **Wishlist:** I'm hoping to retrofit the site with Netlify CMS to replace Medium as the blog.
