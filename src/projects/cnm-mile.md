Multimedia Specialist @ Central New Mexico Community College:

- Developed a multimedia interactive learning experience, to serve as a traditional textbook-replacement written by Brandon Morgan, Ph.D.
- Completed in Inkling Habitat after 2 years of production and development. It includes a few hours of video interviews with experts, interactive maps and graphics, tool tip glossary definitions + inline footnotes, hundreds of historical photographs, and of course text.
- Initially the product was developed in Xcode as an iOS app. It then transitioned to iBooks Author. Upon later consideration, it was converted into Inkling Habitat to be web based so it was device agnostic. It was first sold to CNM students in Fall 2015 for the online course.
